Everyone likes Social Media. For most of us, the day starts and ends with any of the social media applications like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube or any.

It’s a lot of fun and it’s a huge platform for creators. We get likes, comments, shares, favorites, retweets, subscribers and the list goes all the way. Right?

More the likes you get, more popular you are. It’s good.

But apart from these numbers, do these **likes, comments, retweets have any value?**

**NO!**

But that is not the case for the companies like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. They earn a lot of money using advertisements and our data. But for us, few smiles and waste of time.

### To be frank, this is not balanced. Only a few people are getting richer out of it. We the participants are not gaining anything. After all, without us (the participants) these companies have no value too!

As humans evolve, technology too. And **Blockchain** is the product of the evolution.

As you aware, blockchain is a decentralized platform. There are no owners. No one can shut it down.

In the world of blockchain, everything we do has an intrinsic value to it. If you post something and someone likes it, the credit will directly come to you. You can encash those credits and take to your bank accounts anytime.

Which means more likes, more money and happy. So this will be the win-win situation for all. And it is really balanced and all we love this.

There are already communities like Steemit, DTube are getting popular and people started to earn for their hard work and creativity.

Here let me share some blockchain application replacements for the existing so-called Social Media giants.

Replace Reddit with Steemit — [www.steemit.com](https://www.steemit.com/)
